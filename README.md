- Hi, the name is Said. Nice to Meet You!
  
- Currently been working on CS50. Trying to retain as much programming skills I can
- Enrolled in my last (hopefully) semester at Triton College. Once I pass the final class I'm hoping to transfer to U of I.
- Won't be happening for a while cause Advisor didn't advise correctly :(
  
- New to Github but I'm going to post some code that I've implemented.
- Not hard programs but programs to keep my mind running.
- Most if not all of my programs will be written in C++. I find C++ to be the easiest of the languages that I know of that my mind hasn't rejected.
- Don't know exactly where I'll be in my programming career, but I hope that whatever I choose will take me and my family through an easy life
